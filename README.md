#Comms


Simple C crossplatform communications library so that you can forget about network suff (tcp/udp/ssl, etc) and focus on your program communications with others from a simpler and higher level of asbtraction.

##Tested on
Linux (Ubuntu)
Windows XP

###Notes
Currently only basic TCP client and servers are supported (IPv4 and IPv6), but the plan is to extend support to UDP, multicast-UDP and as a compilation option, TLS support (this using GnuTLS)
